## What is Lunalytics

Lunalytics is an open source monitoring tool built with Node.js & React. It's focused on a developer first experience with support for multiple users. This application allows you to monitor various connection types such as HTTP(s),TCP, Ping, JSON Query, etc. We are currently working really hard to add more monitor types, along with other methods of monitoring for developers.

## Why Lunalytics

There are a lot of other monitoring applications, both open source and paid services. But, all the open source applications I tested didn't meet my requirements of supporting multiple users, having a nice developer experience, and lastly a clean and easy to use UI. For the paid applications, while they met the requirements they were either very expensive or had outdated UI. So I decided to spend a bit of time to create my own system that's focused on a developer first experience, along with support for multiple users.
